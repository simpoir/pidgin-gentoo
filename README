Prerequisites
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    * having Gentoo installed
    * pidgin/libpurple
    * having a user in the portage group, or at least, access to the emerge log file (usually /var/log/emerge.log) 
    
Compilation
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    as non-root run:
        # make


Installation
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    still as non-root (aka your normal user) run: 
        # make install

Usage
¯¯¯¯¯
    1. load plugin
    2. change settings (refresh rate, emerge log file) and reload plugin if settings changed
    3. click your status -> Saved statuses...
       select GENTOO then close 

If all goes well, your status should update to "GENTOO building: pkgcategory/pkgname-version" 
currently playing in XMMS2 as the status message.
